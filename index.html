    <p>Hello and welcome to my website. This is somewhere for me to have all of my work in one place. I like to think of it as an archive of sorts for my work, both for things that have been publicly performed or shared and things that I've worked on but not presented. There are collections of both music and film that I have worked on over the years and a calendar for all upcoming events on this website. I will do my best to be in the process of updating the site with new work and events as they come. Please feel free to contact me about anything and I hope you find something to enjoy here :)</p>
